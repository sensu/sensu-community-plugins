# CHANGELOG:
# * 0.4.0:
#   - Adds ability to specify a list of states an individual client can have in
#     EC2. If none is specified, it filters out 'terminated' and 'stopped'
#     instances by default.
#   - Updates how we are "puts"-ing to the log.
# * 0.3.0:
#   - Updates handler to additionally filter stopped instances.
# * 0.2.1:
#   - Updates requested configuration snippets so they'll be redacted by
#     default.
# * 0.2.0:
#   - Renames handler from chef_ec2_node to ec2_node
#   - Removes Chef-related stuff from handler
#   - Updates documentation
# * 0.1.0:
#   - Initial release
#
# This handler deletes a Sensu client if it's been stopped or terminated in EC2.
# Optionally, you may specify a client attribute `ec2_states`, a list of valid
# states an instance may have.
#
# NOTE: The implementation for correlating Sensu clients to EC2 instances may
# need to be modified to fit your organization. The current implementation
# assumes that Sensu clients' names are the same as their instance IDs in EC2.
# If this is not the case, you can either sub-class this handler and override
# `ec2_node_exists?` in your own organization-specific handler, or modify this
# handler to suit your needs.
#
# Requires the following Rubygems (`gem install $GEM`):
#   - sensu-plugin
#   - fog
#
# Requires a Sensu configuration snippet:
#   {
#     "aws": {
#       "access_key": "adsafdafda",
#       "secret_key": "qwuieohajladsafhj23nm",
#       "region": "us-east-1c"
#     }
#   }
#
# Or you can set the following environment variables:
#   - AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
#   - AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
#   - EC2_REGION
#
#
# To use, you can set it as the keepalive handler for a client:
#   {
#     "client": {
#       "name": "i-424242",
#       "address": "127.0.0.1",
#       "keepalive": {
#         "handler": "ec2_node"
#       },
#       "subscriptions": ["all"]
#     }
#   }
#
# You can also use this handler with a filter:
#   {
#     "filters": {
#       "ghost_nodes": {
#         "attributes": {
#           "check": {
#             "name": "keepalive",
#             "status": 2
#           },
#           "occurences": "eval: value > 2"
#         }
#       }
#     },
#     "handlers": {
#       "ec2_node": {
#         "type": "pipe",
#         "command": "/etc/sensu/handlers/ec2_node.rb",
#         "severities": ["warning","critical"],
#         "filter": "ghost_nodes"
#       }
#     }
#   }
