# Handler GTalk
# ===
#
#
# This is a simple Gtalk Handler script for Sensu, Add the GMil credentials and
# Recipient's Gmail id. Currently the message contains Event and Host
#
# Notes:
#   - for Ruby Version > 1.9 compatibility you need to install "xmpp4r-simple-19" gem
#   - if sender is registered for Google Hangouts he can't send message. Maybe it is a
#     problem with XMPP and Hangouts. In this case you need to register a new gmail
#     account and don't register it for Hangouts
#   - If client is registered for Hangouts he will not get the message. Client has to
#     change IM settings to Old version in Gmail page (left side)
