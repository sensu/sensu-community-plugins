# Sensu Dashing(http://shopify.github.io/dashing/) dashboard notifier
#
# This handler sends event information to the dashing api.
#
# The handler pushes event output to widgets named following a convention of:
#  clientname-checkname
#
# For example, if you have a client named mysqlserver and a check named check_diskusage,
# it will send events to a widget with the data-id = mysqlserver-check_diskusage
#
# The event output will be pushed to the moreinfo data-bind of a widget.
#
# This works with a text dashing widget and any others that have a moreinfo data-binding.
#
# Two settings are required in dashing.json
#   auth_token  :  The shared token from you dashing instance.
#   host        :  The ip and port of the dashing instance.
